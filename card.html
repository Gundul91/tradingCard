				<p>Sloths are tropical mammals that live in Central and South America. They use their long claws to hang onto branches while they feast on the leaves that other animals can't reach. Unfortunately for the sloth, their long claws (3 to 4 inches) make walking on the ground difficult, so they spend most of their time in the tall trees they call home.</p>
